#To test server side

Run an instance of Elasticsearch
Run an instance of Kibana in separate terminal

If elasticsearch and kibana are runned localy the
esfrwrdsrvr.py should function with default parameters.

Run esfrwrdsrvr.py by doing: python esfrwrdsrvr.py in terminal

In a separate terminal you can input:
> echo '{"type":"plant_reading","species":"palm3","s_soilmoisture":110}' | nc localhost 1234
This will upload a plant reading to the database.

> echo '{"type":"plant_ideals","species":"palm3","s_light_max":110, "s_light_min":80}' | nc localhost 1234
This will upload a plant ideal to the database


Often encountered problems:


#Kibana wont recognise timestamp on new index.

Solution:
# Make sure the index isn't there
DELETE /sandbox

# Create the index
PUT /sandbox

# Add the mapping of properties to the document type `mem`
PUT /sandbox/_mapping/mem
{
  "mem": {
    "properties": {
      "tstamp": {
        "type": "date"
      },
      "free": {
         "type": "long"
      }
    }
  }
}
